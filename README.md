# MyClassesCS
The project consists of different data structures and basic classes implemented from scratch using C# and is 
aimed for **people *starting* their route in Computer Science**. It also act's as a storage of learned concepts learned by myself.

## Inspiration
The classes implemented are heavily inpired by the AiSD1/2, P3Z, OOD, etc. subjects of the MiNI faculty in Warsaw University of Technology.

## Current state
At this momment the project contains the following data structures fully implemented:
- Heap
- Single dimenstional matrix
- List based on singly linked nodes
- Stack
- Various nodes for corresponding class
- Sequence matcher class implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
- Sequence class which is a generalization approach for automatic creation of **random** class instances (*curretly implemented for basic **.Net** types*)
- AVL Tree
- BST Tree
- Graphs (*Directed, Undirected with Dictionary or Matrix representation*) and additional functionality for them
- Deep Search First Algorithm

### The project is evolving, it's not ideal, but tryes to show all the power of the C# programming language, it's functionality and features.
